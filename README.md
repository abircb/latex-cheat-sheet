# LaTeX Cheat Sheet

<img src="/src/icons/icon16.png"> LaTeX Cheat Sheet is a browser extension for Google Chrome that provides easy access to many of the commands and packages used to create LaTeX documents; be it as simple as `x^{2}` or something as unfamiliar as BibTeX, this cheat sheet has got you covered.

Best used as a syntax-guide while TeX'ing on online text-editors, like [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/)
